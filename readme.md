We use pair-programming for development, you can see which pair made which commit by looking at the branches README.md.  


The project consists of creating a program which will be able to generate scientific style papers made up of syntactically accurate text but not make scientific sense. 
We aim to achieve this by reading data from a large database of scientific papers and tracking which words follow each other to build up some statistics which we can
then use the probability of to form sentences.
